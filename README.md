## Graduate Research Assistant                                                                                        Aug 2018 - Aug 2019 
Mentor: Distinguished Prof. Yuri Shtessel

> This research work is supported by NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Control System and Design Analysis Branch (EV41) 
under the contract MSFC (80NSSC18P1623).
* Developing a novel MATLAB/Simulink based Aerospace Sliding Mode Control Toolbox
* The developed toolbox is verified on Resource Prospector Lander and Launch Vehicle 
* The created Sliding Mode Control Toolbox will be used at NASA/MSFC for designing the robust control systems for various aerospace missions.

# Industrial Experience 

## Electrical Design Engineering Co-op  (Aug 2019 - Dec 2019) 
General Electric Appliances, a Haier company, Lafayette, GA, USA

> 2019 NPI Phase-I Leadership wall oven Program
* Interfaced NPI team, manufacturing, operations, sourcing, suppliers, as well as program managers to champion the transition from design to mass production.
* Utilized build management practices to assist in the co-ordination trial runs.

## New Product Introduction Project Engineer (Aug 2015 – Jan 2018) 
General Electric Appliances, a Haier company, Lafayette, GA, USA

> 2017 NPI Front Control and Free-Standing Electric Range Program 
* Major responsibilities revolved around the support of design engineers on an NPI program.
