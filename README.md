> This research work is supported by NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Control System and Design Analysis Branch (EV41) 
under the contract MSFC (80NSSC18P1623).
* Developing a novel MATLAB/Simulink based Aerospace Sliding Mode Control Toolbox
* The developed toolbox is verified on Resource Prospector Lander and Launch Vehicle 
* The created Sliding Mode Control Toolbox will be used at NASA/MSFC for designing the robust control systems for various aerospace missions.
